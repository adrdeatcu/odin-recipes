    <li>1 pound dry penne</li>
    <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 can of tuna in olive oil</li>

</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the penne, and cook for 12 minutes, making sure to stir the pasta in the beginning of the boil so it doesnt stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan over medium high heat, add your olive oil, and when it begins to shimmer, add the capers, letting them fry for a minute.</li>
    <li>Add the tuna in its olive oil, and let it fry for a couple minutes. Stir.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta sauce, and the box of strained tomatoes. Bring to a gentle simmer, and stir, uncovered.</li>
    <li>Season with garlic powder, salt, pepper.</li>
    <li>The penne should be done by now, so drain it, and return the pasta to the same pot. Pour all the hot sauce over the penne and stir to incorporate.</li>
